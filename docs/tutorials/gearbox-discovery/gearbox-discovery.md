# Gearbox Discovery

Now that we have completed

 we have a great environment for playing with [Gearbox](https://gearbox.fi/). And we also create a simple example to query the latest version of the Gearbox's contracts. 

Now let's jump into Gearbox. In this chapter, we will introduce the architecture of Gearbox smart contracts and go through a series of query examples to better understand the resposibility of each component and how they work together.
