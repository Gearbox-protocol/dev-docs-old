# Build Upon Gearbox

As we know, Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol: it allows anyone to take leverage in a DeFi-native way and then use it across various DeFi protocols in a composable way. From previous chapters we know that we can open `CreditAccount`s in Gearbox to take leverage. But how to intergrate with other Defi protocols and how to make a trading bot to trade? we still don't know. Thus, in this chapter, we mainly talk these two things:
  * Adapter
  * Trading Bot
