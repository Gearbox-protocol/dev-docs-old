# Build Upon Gearbox

As we know, Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol: it allows anyone to take leverage in a DeFi-native way and then use it across various DeFi protocols in a composable way. From previous chapters we know that we can open `CreditAccount`s in Gearbox to take leverage. But how to intergrate with other Defi protocols and how to make a trading bot to trade?  

Thus, in this chapter, we mainly talk these two things:
  
* [Adapter](./adapter.md)
* [Trading Bot](./trading-bot/trading-bot.md)
