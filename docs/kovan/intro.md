The tutorials mostly build/test on the hardhat local network or forking network. There are some limitations testing only on local network so it is necessary to test on a public testnet of ethereum. We choose kovan since kovan is a stable testnet. We have built Gearbox Protocol on kovan testnet, please check the [deployed contracts](/docs/kovan/deployed-contracts). 

In this chapter, we will discuss how to migrate the code from tutorials to interacting with Gearbox Protocol on kovan.
