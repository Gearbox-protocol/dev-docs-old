# Adding collateral

We strongly recommend to use `addCollateral` method in `CreditFacade` contract instead of tranferring tokens directly to credit account.
This method is designed for your safety, let's check advantages:

- It works with `borrower` address instead of credit account address, so it would be reverted, if borrower closed his account or 
such account was liquidated
- It enables token, if such a token wasn't enabled before

## Method

### Normal call
```solidity
function addCollateral(
    address onBehalfOf,
    address token,
    uint256 amount
) external payable;
```
