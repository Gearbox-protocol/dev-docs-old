# Liquidation Threshold in details

Gearbox uses Chainlink price feeds (as do Aave and Compound) to estimate Credit Accountâ€™s Health Factors. The problem here is to set correct values of  Liquidation Thresholds, so that while a liquidation is in progress (a liquidation always takes some time), the price does not become too low,resulting in a loss of LP's funds. 

This problem can be formulated in math language as 

$$
LT \le 1 - dP- f_L-f_p,
$$
where $dP$ is max price drop during liquidation time, $f_L$ - liquidation fee (goes to liquidator), $f_p$ - liquidation premium.
